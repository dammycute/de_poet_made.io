      	<p style="color:white; font-size:22px;">Living in an age Where there is utmost uncertainty.<br/><br/>
      	It is easier for a young man to lose his identity.<br/><br/>
      	Surrounded with more than enough things to worry about. <br/><br/>
      	It leaves us with a lots of <b>Confusion</b>, anxiety and doubt.
      	<br/><br/>My main target is Confusion<br/><br/>Because he watches his victims suffer crazy conditions
      	<br/><br/>It almost like you are going crazy.<br/><br/>
      	It affects the dilligent and even the lazy.<br/><br/>
      	Yea am aware about the normality<br/><br/>
      	But am talking about the abnormality<br/><br/>
      	When you are really confused with everything in your life.<br/><br/>A situation where you have a lots of decisions to make and you don't even know where to start. <br/><br/>Or a situation where all your beliefs and perceptions are becoming untrue.<br/><br/>
      	And you are already looking like a fool.<br/><br/>
      	A situation when you are bombarded with all sorts of informations <br/><br/>
      	And you don't even know where to start your own calculations<br/><br/>A situation when nobody understands you anymore because you are acting strange.<br/><br/>
      	But you also cannot explain the reasons behind your actions because you feel caged. <br/><br/>
      	You are stucked between many opinions and you don't know what to say.<br/><br/>You look through the mirror and flipped through the page.
      	<br/><br/>Searching and thinking you've arrived until everything begins to fade <br/><br/>
      	At that point, all you could say is <b>why</b>.<br/><br/>
      	Because it's gotten to a point when all you could do is <b>cry</b>.
      	<br/><br/>You've been crippled to stay on your bed.<br/><br/>
      	By the yes in your mind and a lots of no in your head.<br/><br/>
      	You are really not alone!
      	<br/><br/><br/><br/>
      	God is willing to help if you allow him to...
