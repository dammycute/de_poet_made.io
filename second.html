      		This is nothing but Delusion!<br/><br/>
      		With what I've seen, here is my conclusion.<br/><br/>
      		The world today is swimming in a sea of endless illusion.<br/><br/>
      		And what can I say, this in turn brings a lots of confusion.<br/><br/>
      		I am particular about you, You had a strong knowledge of what you are created for.<br/><br/>
      		But what happened? Do you suddenly got bored?<br/><br/>
      		You had a dream, You had a vision.<br/><br/>
      		You had a goal, You had a mission.<br/><br/>
      		But the fear, the guilt, resentment with you.<br/><br/>
      		Blocked every possibilities of your dream.<br/><br/>
      		You now prefer sitting at the corner of your bed watching film.
      		<br/><br/>I can feel it, maybe it not that you've forgotten,
      		<br/><br/>Maybe it just that you can't seems to bypass the hurtings.<br/><br/>
      		Hey! Do you know He understands more than you do.<br/><br/>Do you know He was tempted like you too<br/><br/>Maybe the greatest consolation is in <b>Heb 4:15-16</b>
      		<br/><br/><br/><br/>
      		At the end, maybe it's not really about you<br/><br/>
      		Maybe it's about myself<br/><br/>The feeling of a strong sense of purpose but a controversial thoughts and emotion within.<br/><br/>But in the real sense I realise: <b>He Is Willing To Help</b><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Fear, Guilt of our past mistakes, resentment, needs for approval and a lots of things controls our lives, they are those delusions stopping us from becoming and pursuing our God given dreams and visions.<br/><br/>What is stopping you from pursuing your God given dream.... (.......) You can fill the gap but do you know God understands what and why you are facing that problem...?<br/><br/>
      		 Do you know He wants you to fulfill His purpose more than you do...? No matter what is happening in your life <b>He is able to Help.</b>
