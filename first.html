      	<br/><br/>Are they some part of emotion which must be sorted out...?<br/><br/>
      	Or are they some daydreaming stuff which I must doubt...?<br/><br/>Because <b>hatred</b> and <b>Love</b> are some sort of emotions which comes a feelings.<br/><br/>
      	How can a young man be helped, who can not understand the meanings (really confused whether to allow some feelings or not.)<br/><br/>
      	Because some feelings seems to tamper with sanity.<br/><br/>
      	Some feeling even hamper sanctity.<br/><br/>
      	Why are feelings and emotions seemingly stronger than humanity...?
      	<br/><br/>And we can only get help from divinity...
